Coding Bootcamp homework 1

This homework assignment involved giving the index.html document a clear, concise and descriptive title, converting the existing code into a semantic html format, ensuring that the webpage is functional by linking the items in the nav bar to the relevant section on the website, and inputting alt attributes in the img tags.

The CSS code had to have a logical structure, layed out and tabbed correctly. All selectors that can be grouped have been grouped, and the css has been fixed so that the launched website resembles the mockup provided.
